motion-svn-patchwork
====================

This is a repo with patches I have collected from different Github forks of "motion".  
Those patches are recommended to check in into original SVN. Patches are made for SVN trunk tree revision r561

To apply patches use this command:
```
svn patch filename.patch
```

After merging the tree should match "motion-3.4" branch of Mr-Dave fork:
